# Oracle Risk

This risk is when the oracle reports erranous values for the price of a Future token and hence, a repeater is allowed to mint more tokens than they are supposed to.

## Mitigations

1. Use a centralised oracle when there is low liquidity and then switch to UniswapV3 TWAP oracle to negate price manipulation risks.
