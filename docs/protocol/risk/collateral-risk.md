# Collateral Risk

As for any lending protocol, this protocol has collateral risk. This risk occurs when the collateral amount is worth lesser than the _borrowed_ `Mint Rewards`. This risk is minimal since, repeaters still have oppurtinity until block expiry to make their collateral worth more by burning the tokens and reducin the value of the _borrowed_ `Mint Rewards`. If they default, liquidators can liquidate the collateral to return some consolation amount to the user who had the tokens.
