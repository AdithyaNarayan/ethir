# Blockspace as a Market 

This page explains why it makes sense for blockspace to be packaged and sold as a token or security.

Let us take a look at the synonyms between the transaction pool auction and a security/commodity market.

| Mempool/TxnPool      | Auction/Markets |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Transaction          | Order           |
| `gasFee` * `gasUsed` | Bid             |
| Users                | Bidders/Buyers  |
| Validators/Miners    | Sellers         |
| BLOCKSPACE           | COMMODITY       |

It is clear to see that this is a commodity market. However, unlike most commodity markets, a futures derivate does not yet exist for this commodity.

## Futures

From a users perspective, what does it mean to have blockspace futures? Currently, transactions that you propagate to the `txnpool` can be chosen to be added to the block at any point in time by the validator. There is no way for the user to request the validator to add a transaction at a specific time/block. If blockspace futures were to exist, users could reserve blockspace at a particular time or block.

There would also be a marketplace for these blockspace futures and this can be used by traders to hedge their exposure to the gas price fluctuations. Hence, as a result of a new and liquid blockspace futures market, there is now price discovery for gas fees at a later date.
